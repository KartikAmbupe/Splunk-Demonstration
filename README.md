## Functionalities Demonstrated

### 1. Login Attempt Tracking
**Objective:** Monitor successful and failed login attempts to detect unauthorized access.

**Steps:**
1. Search for Windows Security Logs related to login events using Splunk.
2. Use the following query to retrieve login attempts:
   ```spl
   index=* sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625)
   | eval Status=if(EventCode=4624, "Successful Login", "Failed Login")
   | table _time, Account_Name, src_ip, Status
   ```
3. Create a visualization using a timechart to observe trends in login activity.

### 2. Read/Write File Access Monitoring
**Objective:** Track file access attempts, including read and write operations.

**Steps:**
1. Enable file auditing in Windows Security settings for specific directories.
2. Use Splunk to search for file access events (EventCode 4663):
   ```spl
